The book consists of 16 chapters, organized into four parts. The first part introduces the basic concepts of signals and systems, such as classification, representation, analysis, and transformation of signals and systems. The second part deals with continuous-time (CT) and discrete-time (DT) Fourier series and transforms, as well as the Hilbert transform and its applications. The third part covers the Laplace transform and the z-transform, along with their properties, inverse transforms, and applications to linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. The fourth part discusses the concepts of sampling, modulation, demodulation, filtering, and correlation of signals.
 
The book features more than 300 solved examples and numerous numerical problems and multiple choice questions for practice at the end of every chapter. The book also includes a separate chapter on MATLAB, with examples illustrating its application to signals and systems. The book also provides model question papers to prepare students for examinations.
 
Signals and Systems by Tarun Kumar Rawat is a comprehensive and rigorous guide for engineering students who want to master the theory and applications of signals and systems. The book is available in paperback format from Oxford University Press[^2^].

Here are some of the key topics covered in the book:
 
- Classification of signals and systems: The book explains the different types of signals and systems, such as deterministic and random, periodic and aperiodic, even and odd, causal and non-causal, energy and power, linear and nonlinear, time-invariant and time-varying, stable and unstable, etc.
- Representation of signals and systems: The book introduces the various methods of representing signals and systems in different domains, such as time domain, frequency domain, s-domain, z-domain, etc. The book also discusses the concepts of impulse response, convolution, impulse train, Dirac delta function, unit step function, ramp function, etc.
- Analysis of signals and systems: The book covers the techniques of analyzing signals and systems using different tools, such as Fourier series, Fourier transform, Laplace transform, z-transform, etc. The book also explains the properties and theorems of these transforms, such as linearity, superposition, convolution, modulation, shifting, scaling, differentiation, integration, etc.
- Transformation of signals and systems: The book describes the methods of transforming signals and systems from one domain to another using different operators, such as differentiation operator, integration operator, delay operator, advance operator, etc. The book also illustrates the applications of these operators to solve differential equations and difference equations.
- Hilbert transform: The book introduces the concept of Hilbert transform and its relation to Fourier transform. The book also explains the applications of Hilbert transform to signal processing problems, such as envelope detection, phase detection, single sideband modulation (SSB), analytic signal representation (ASR), etc.
- Sampling: The book discusses the concept of sampling and its effects on signals and systems. The book also covers the topics of sampling theorem (Nyquist criterion), aliasing (frequency folding), reconstruction (interpolation), quantization (rounding), coding (binary representation), etc.
- Modulation: The book explains the concept of modulation and its types, such as amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), phase modulation (PM), pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), pulse width modulation (PWM), pulse position modulation (PPM), etc. The book also describes the methods of demodulation or detection of modulated signals.
- Filtering: The book covers the concept of filtering and its types, such as low-pass filter (LPF), high-pass filter (HPF), band-pass filter (BPF), band-stop filter (BSF), notch filter (NF), all-pass filter (APF), etc. The book also discusses the design of filters using different techniques, such as Butterworth filter design (maximally flat magnitude response), Chebyshev filter design (equiripple magnitude response), Bessel filter design (maximally flat phase response), etc.
- Correlation: The book introduces the concept of correlation and its types, such as auto-correlation (ACF), cross-correlation (CCF), circular correlation (CCF'), etc. The book also explains the applications of correlation to signal processing problems, such as signal detection (matched filter), signal estimation (Wiener filter), signal enhancement (adaptive filter), etc.

The book is written in a clear and concise manner with ample examples and illustrations to help students understand the concepts and techniques. The book is also supplemented with online resources for instructors and students on the Oxford University Press website.
