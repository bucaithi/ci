## Enhanced Smart Matching
 
One of the features that sets MyHeritage Family Tree Builder Premium apart from other software is the Enhanced Smart Matching technology. This feature matches your tree to millions of others on MyHeritage and discovers new relatives for you automatically. You can confirm and reject matches, contact the site managers of other trees, and even merge your trees with theirs if you find a common ancestor. This way, you can expand your family tree and discover new branches of your family that you never knew existed[^1^].
 
## Access to MyHeritage Collections
 
Another benefit of using MyHeritage Family Tree Builder Premium is that you get access to two of the MyHeritage collections in the MyHeritage Search Engine. These are the MyHeritage family sites and the MyHeritage members collections, which contain millions of profiles and trees created by other users. You can search these collections for your ancestors and relatives, and find valuable information such as names, dates, places, photos and documents. You can also contact the owners of these profiles and trees and collaborate with them on your research[^1^].
 
## Advanced DNA Features
